nocall
======

Please don't cold call team members without context. It interrupts [flow state](https://medium.com/software-development/the-people-that-work-for-you-need-to-get-into-flow-peopleware-4ad5d64b1467), creates an artificial sense of urgency, and can cause anxiety. Cold calling can be presumptive that what you are calling about is more important than the call recipient's current activity, and in the context of workplace power dynamics, this could put your teammate in an uncomfortable position.

Instead, send a message giving context for the call:
  - Purpose of call, what you want to get out of it and why
  - Importance of call, do we need to talk about it now or can it wait until later
  - Opportunity for alternatives and backup plans in case an impromptu call is not possible

Thank you for not cold calling your teammates, and please be understanding if your unscheduled calls are not picked up.
