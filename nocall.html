Please don't call without context, it interrupts flow state, can cause anxiety, and gives an artificial sense of urgency. Cold calling can be presumptive that what you are needing the person for is more important than their current activity, and in combination with workplace power dynamics could put your teammate in a tricky spot.

Instead, send a message giving context for the call and respectfully asking permission.
	- Purpose of call, what you want to get out of it and why
	- Importance of call, do we need to talk about it now or can we get to it later
	- Opportunity for alternatives and fallback plans in case a call is not possible

Thank you for not cold calling your coworkers, and please be understanding if your unscheduled calls are not picked up.
